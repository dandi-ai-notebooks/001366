# ## Summary of NWB File Contents
#
# Based on the `nwb-file-info` tool (and direct inspection if loaded), the selected NWB file (`sub-031224-M4/..._image.nwb`) contains:
#
# *   **Session Description:** "the mouse skull was thinned at the area of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and fitted with a headpost. A cranial window was created over the MCA territory. Then the mouse was moved to a two-photon microscope for imaging with a 20x objective lens (Olympus). The imaging depth from the cortical surface to the focal plane was ~100 Î¼m. Blood vessels were visualized by intravenous injection of Texas Red dextran (70 kDa)." (Partially inferred, full description from NWB file: `nwb.session_description`).
# *   **Identifier:** `Qinwen_6th_March_03122024-m4-baseline`
# *   **Session Start Time:** `2024-03-12T01:00:00-04:00`
# *   **Experimenter(s):** `Huang, Qinwen`
# *   **Acquisition Data:**
#     *   `Movies`: An `ImageSeries` object.
#         *   Description: "16-bit grayscale movie of a pial vessel"
#         *   Data shape: `(6000, 512, 512)` (frames, height, width)
#         *   Data type: `uint16`
#         *   Frame rate (rate): `30.0` Hz
#         *   Unit: `n.a.`
# *   **Subject Information:**
#     *   Age: `P2M` (Postnatal 2 months)
#     *   Sex: `M` (Male)
#     *   Species: `Mus musculus`
#     *   Strain: `C57BL/6`
#     *   Subject ID: `031224_M4`
#
# The primary data appears to be two-photon imaging movies of pial vessels.

# ### Explore on Neurosift
#
# You can explore this NWB file interactively on Neurosift using the following link:
#
# [https://neurosift.app/nwb?url=https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/2f12bce3-f841-46ca-b928-044269122a59/download/&dandisetId=001366&dandisetVersion=0.250324.1603](https://neurosift.app/nwb?url=https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/2f12bce3-f841-46ca-b928-044269122a59/download/&dandisetId=001366&dandisetVersion=0.250324.1603)

# ## Load and Visualize Data from the NWB File
#
# We will now load a single frame from the `Movies` acquisition data and display it. The `Movies.data` object is an HDF5 dataset, so we need to explicitly slice it to load data into memory.

# %%

    # Select a frame to display (e.g., the first frame)
    frame_index_to_display = 0 # You can change this to view other frames
    if movies_data.shape[0] > frame_index_to_display:
        # Load only the selected frame into memory
        # Using [frame_index_to_display] directly on the HDF5 dataset
        # is efficient as it loads only that specific frame.
        example_frame = movies_data[frame_index_to_display, :, :]

        plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
        # Not using seaborn style for images

# The plot above shows a single frame from the two-photon imaging movie. This gives a snapshot of the pial vessel structure at a specific time point. The data is 16-bit, providing a good dynamic range for intensity values.

# ## Summary and Future Directions
#
# This notebook demonstrated how to:
# *   Connect to the DANDI archive and retrieve information about Dandiset 001366.
# *   List assets within the Dandiset.
# *   Load a specific NWB file (`sub-031224-M4/..._image.nwb`) from the Dandiset by streaming its content from the web.
# *   Inspect basic metadata and structure of the NWB file.
# *   Visualize a sample frame from the `Movies` `ImageSeries` contained in the NWB file.
#
# ### Possible Future Directions:
#
# 1.  **Analyze Vessel Dynamics:** The primary data consists of movies. One could analyze these movies to:
#     *   Quantify vessel diameter changes over time.
#     *   Measure vessel pulsatility.
#     *   Track blood flow characteristics (if applicable and visible).
# 2.  **Process Image Stacks:** For volumetric imaging data (if present in other files or if this is a Z-stack represented as a time series), reconstruct 3D volumes.
# 3.  **Compare Across Subjects/Sessions:** If other NWB files in the Dandiset represent different subjects or experimental conditions (e.g., `sub-F15/..._image.nwb`), comparative analyses could be performed.
# 4.  **Explore Other Data Types:** While this file primarily showcased `ImageSeries`, other NWB files or other sections within this file might contain different data types (e.g., time series related to physiological signals, behavioral data, etc.) that could be explored.
# 5.  **Apply Image Processing Techniques:** Use image processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV, Scikit-image) for tasks like image registration, segmentation, or feature extraction from the vessel movies.
#
# This notebook provides a starting point. The specific analysis will depend on the research questions and the full content of the Dandiset. Remember to consult the Dandiset's documentation and associated publications for more context.
