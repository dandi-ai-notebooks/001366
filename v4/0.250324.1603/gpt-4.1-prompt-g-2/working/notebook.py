#
# **Scientific context:**  
# Surface (pial) vessel pulsatility and diameter fluctuations reflect brain physiology and are quantified using two-photon or epifluorescence imaging. This data is useful for studying blood flow, vessel biomechanics, and cerebrovascular health. Accurately measuring the vessel diameter over time aids in comparing quantification algorithms (e.g., Radon transform, FWHM methods). This Dandiset provides high-spatiotemporal-resolution movies of mouse pial vessels for algorithmic and physiological analyses.

#
# ## Loading and Visualizing Data from the NWB File
#
# Here is how to open and explore the file using PyNWB and remfile (streaming):

# %%
import pynwb
import h5py
import remfile
import numpy as np

# URL for remote NWB file (Asset ID as above)
nwb_url = "https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/71fa07fc-4309-4013-8edd-13213a86a67d/download/"

# Open the NWB file remotely
remote_file = remfile.File(nwb_url)
h5_file = h5py.File(remote_file)
io = pynwb.NWBHDF5IO(file=h5_file)
nwb = io.read()

# Show expanded NWB file structure: root, acquisition, and Movies fields
def print_nwb_hierarchy(obj, indent=""):
    if hasattr(obj, "keys"):
        for k in obj.keys():
            print(f"{indent}- {k}")
            try:
                print_nwb_hierarchy(obj[k], indent + "  ")
            except Exception:
                pass

# ## Exploring the Movies Data
#
# The main data in this NWB file is the time-lapse movie stored in the "Movies" acquisition. For illustration,
# we examine only the first 100 frames to ensure interactive performance.
#
# **Note:** For analysis, you may wish to process more or all frames, but streaming large arrays over the network can be slow.

# %%
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load first n_subset frames just once for analysis and plotting
num_frames = movies.data.shape[0]
height = movies.data.shape[1]
width = movies.data.shape[2]
n_subset = min(100, num_frames)
frames = np.array(movies.data[0:n_subset])

print(f"Movies data shape: {movies.data.shape}, dtype: {movies.data.dtype}")
print(f"Total frames: {num_frames}, Frame size: {height}x{width}")
print(f"Analyzing the first {n_subset} frames only.")

# %% [markdown]
# #### Mean Image Across the First 100 Frames

# %%
# Compute mean image across time (only for first 100 frames for speed)
mean_image = frames.mean(axis=0)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
im = ax.imshow(mean_image, cmap="gray")
ax.set_title(f"Movies Mean Image (First {n_subset} Frames)")
plt.colorbar(im, ax=ax)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# The above plot shows the average intensity projection across the first 100 frames, highlighting the location and size of the pial vessel.

# %% [markdown]
# #### Sample Frame From the Movie

# %%
sample_frame = frames[0]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
im = ax.imshow(sample_frame, cmap="gray")
ax.set_title("Sample Frame 0 from Movies")
plt.colorbar(im, ax=ax)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# This single frame provides a snapshot of the vessel and background tissue at one timepoint.
#
# **Frame stats (first 100 frames):**

# %%
print("Mean pixel value (mean image):", mean_image.mean())
print("Std pixel value (mean image):", mean_image.std())
print("Sample frame 0 min/max:", sample_frame.min(), sample_frame.max())

# ## Temporal Analysis: Simple Time Series and Kymograph

# %% [markdown]
# ### ROI Intensity Time Series
#
# As this dataset concerns vessel diameter and pulsatility, a useful first step is to examine the intensity time-series in a small region over time. For demonstration, we compute the average intensity in a small square ROI centered on the middle of the image (approximate vessel center):

# %%
roi_center = (height//2, width//2)
roi_halfsize = 5
roi = frames[:, roi_center[0]-roi_halfsize:roi_center[0]+roi_halfsize, roi_center[1]-roi_halfsize:roi_center[1]+roi_halfsize]
roi_timeseries = roi.mean(axis=(1,2))

plt.figure()
plt.plot(np.arange(n_subset) / movies.rate, roi_timeseries)
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Mean intensity (ROI)")
plt.title("ROI-averaged Intensity Over Time (First 100 Frames)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# ### Kymograph Along a Line**
#
# A "kymograph" is a 2D image showing how pixel intensity evolves over time along a line (e.g., perpendicular to the vessel). Here, we extract a vertical line across the vessel center in each frame:

# %%
line_x = roi_center[1]
kymograph = frames[:, :, line_x]
plt.figure(figsize=(7,5))
plt.imshow(kymograph.T, aspect='auto', cmap="gray", origin="lower",
           extent=[0, n_subset / movies.rate, 0, height])
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Position along vessel (pixels)")
plt.title("Kymograph: Intensity Along Central Vertical Line vs Time")
plt.colorbar()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]
# The kymograph shows how the vesselâ€™s diameter and position may change over time. This is a simple, visual way to seek evidence of pulsatility or motion.

# ---
# ## Next Steps and Further Exploration
#
# - Explore additional ROIs for diameter or position tracking.
# - Calculate vessel boundaries by thresholding or edge detection for each frame to estimate diameter changes.
# - Compare quantification approaches: Radon transform, FWHM, manual annotation metrics, etc.
# - Analyze multiple datasets, experimental conditions, or mouse subjects as required for your research question.
#
# **Interpretation tip:**  
# The mean image reveals vessel layout, kymograph shows temporal dynamics, and simple ROI time series can help identify vessel pulsatility. For robust vessel diameter quantification, consider additional image processing and diligent validation.
#
# To explore more data or other NWB files from this Dandiset, repeat the loading steps above and consult DANDI/NWB documentation for advanced usage.

# ## Summary and Research Context
#
# This notebook demonstrated:
# - Accessing Dandiset 001366 using the DANDI API
# - Navigating the NWB file structure and displaying metadata
# - Loading and summarizing a microscopy movie from an NWB file
# - Visualizing both the mean image and an individual timepoint to reveal vessel structure
# - Creating a simple kymograph and ROI timeseries for initial pulsatility exploration
#
# **Next steps:**  
# For detailed analyses and a rigorous comparison of measurement approaches, users are encouraged to try out different vessel quantification algorithms and perform further temporal/statistical analysis using the raw data here.
#
# **Please verify results and code before conducting further analysis or drawing conclusions from these data.**
